I am a Master's student in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. 
I am working on a research project, under Dr. Craver, that is part of the Water for the World lab.
My research topic is titled 'Enhanced Street Sweeping'. The goal is to develop optimal methods to street sweeping in urban areas,
consudering both the location and frequency of sweeping events
