## About My Studies
I am a Master's student in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. 
I am working on a research project, under Dr. Craver, that is part of the Water for the World lab.
My research topic is titled 'Enhanced Street Sweeping'. The goal is to develop optimal methods to street sweeping in urban areas,
considering both the location and frequency of sweeping events. I collect stormwater and street solid samples and perform analysis to understand
the accumulation rates of heavy metals, nutrients, hydrocarbons, and microplastics. I also use GIS to calculate metrics that summaruze areas around a road, such as land use, impervious surface area, canopy coverage, building density, road quality, and watershed impairment. Check out my [Story Map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/113f119bbf244f74968067d8eea4cee1) that explains this process. 
The idea is to determine relationships between road characteristics and pollutant loadings, which will help make decisions on which roads to prioritize street sweeping.
The results of this work will enable Rhode Island Department of Transportation to help restore the water quality in the surrounding areas.

Before I came to URI, I obtained a B.S. in Systems Engineering and Sustainability at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Here, I was able to develop many technical skills, such as data analytics and computer-based modelling, which has helped support my studies at URI.
