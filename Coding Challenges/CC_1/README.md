## My Studies
I am a Master's student in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. 
I am working on a research project, under Dr. Craver, that is part of the Water for the World lab.
My research topic is titled 'Enhanced Street Sweeping'. The goal is to develop optimal methods to street sweeping in urban areas,
considering both the location and frequency of sweeping events. I collect stormwater and street solid samples and perform analysis to understand
the accumulation rates of heavy metals, nutrients, hydrocarbons, and microplastics. I also use GIS to calculate metrics that summarize areas around a road, such as land use, impervious surface area, canopy coverage, building density, road quality, and watershed impairment. Check out my [Story Map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/113f119bbf244f74968067d8eea4cee1) that explains this process. 
The idea is to determine relationships between road characteristics and pollutant loadings, which will help make decisions on which roads to prioritize street sweeping.
The results of this work will enable Rhode Island Department of Transportation to help restore the water quality in the surrounding areas.

Before I came to URI, I obtained a B.S. in Systems Engineering and Sustainability at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Here, I was able to develop many technical skills, such as data analytics and computer-based modelling, which has helped support my studies at URI. 


## My Interests
I have lived in Newport, Rhode Island my entire life (except for my 4 years at GW). I learned to sail at an early age and never stopped. I would consider sailing my biggest passion, as I have been racing competitively for the past 15 years at the regional, national, and even international level. I sailed for GW while I was in college. I have also coached sailing for the past 8 years, and am currently assistant coaching for the URI sailing team. As much as I love sailing, I understand the importance of balancing in other activities. I also enjoy to ski, road bike, mountain bike, and play golf. I like to keep the mind active by playing chess and completing riddle-like games. And I couldn't go without mentioning my dog, Mack, who I love to play and go on adventures with.
